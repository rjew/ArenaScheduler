#ArenaScheduler

A currently work in progress scheduling program for Arena. This program is meant to help shorten the time it takes to create schedules for the arena. It has a search catalog so that you can search the announcer with your specified search parameters. It allows you to create custom schedules and modify them: adding classes, renaming schedules, duplicating schedules, rankings schedules, etc.

This program is still a work in progress. So far it only works on the command line and does not have any implemented gui. More features planned to be added. The program currently uses the fall 2015 announcer as the announcer for spring 2016 has yet to come out.
